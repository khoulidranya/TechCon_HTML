                <p>
                    The Mission 770 story starts with the BBC. The broadcast corporation’s famed engineering department did a great deal of research into speaker design during the 1960s. Spencer Hughes was one of the engineers working on the research projects, and he went on to found Spendor. Using the knowledge gained during his time with the Beeb, Hughes designed Spendor’s first product, the BC-1 loudspeaker, in 1969. This was a hugely influential design and set the template for what many still think of as the BBC (or British) </p>

                <p>
                    The TechCon conference has been run by different groups during its history. Previously it was organised as part of the UK Radio Festival, under The Radio Academy. Since 2016 it has been run independently by TBC Media Ltd. due to limited resources at The Radio Academy

                    TBC Media Ltd. is run by Ann Charles and Aradhna Tayal, who are former committee members of TechCon from its Radio Festival days. TBC Media Ltd. exists to support the UK radio and audio industry by running events to support the technical community, most notably Radio TechCon.
